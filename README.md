# citi-bike-analysis
Using Tableau, visualize Citi Bike aggregate data.

## Summary
The objective of this project was to take aggregated New York City Citi Bike data from May 2020 to April 2021 and perform trend analysis through that period. The intent was to act as if we were a new hire for Citi bike and that this data would be presented to leadership to help improve the city program. This was achieved by:

* Finding two unexpected phenomenas in the data and creating 2-5 visualizations for each.
* Creating a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Creating a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

Once those objectives were achieved, we tied all of the data together in the form of a Story which would be shared with the mock leadership. The story was written in such a way that it assumed the readers are not data analysts.
